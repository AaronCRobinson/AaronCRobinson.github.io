## About

At a young age I found a passion for computing and studied programming in high school. I continued my studies through technical school and then at [High Point University](http://www.highpoint.edu/) where I dual degreed in computer science and mathematics. In addition, I gained a passion for science and religion at university by minoring in physics and eastern philosophy.  

*"But science can only be created by those who are thoroughly imbued with the aspiration toward truth and understanding. This source of feeling, however, springs from the sphere of religion."* -Einstein 

During my education I took an extended route in order to study greater breadth. First working in databases to build an understanding of the challenges related to data management and analytics. Over the summers I did research assistantships, first in high performance computing and then in bioinformatics. After graduating, I continued to support bioinformatics before transitioning into a software development environment.

*"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."* -Einstein

Throughout my life I have maintained a passion to understand. To further my understandings I supported academia throughout my education as a tutor and student instructor in computing and mathematics. It is my fervent belief that the beauty of this creature is our propensity to understand and that through understanding, we can transform our world beyond our own fathomability. 

*"Understand through compassion or you will misunderstand the times."* -Yogi Bhajan

I cannot say what has led such a radical animal to develop on a small rock in the seeming infinitude of the universe but if `God` is a computer, then we are simultaneously the program and the programmer.

Hack the planet but with compassion and prudence.
