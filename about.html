## About

Hello. I am Aaron Robinson. I grew up traveling and found a passion for computing at a young age. I started programming in high school, went to technical college for computer programming, databases, and information technology. I continued my studies at [High Point University](http://www.highpoint.edu/) in computer science and mathematics. In addition, I gained a passion for science and philosphy. 

*"But science can only be created by those who are thoroughly imbued with the aspiration toward truth and understanding. This source of feeling, however, springs from the sphere of religion."* -Einstein 

I cannot say what has lead such a radical animal to develop on a small rock in the seemingly infitude of the universe but if `God` is a computer, then we are simultaneously the program and the programmer. 

Hack the planet but with compassion and prudence.
